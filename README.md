# JDInnoSetupConfig
 Inno Setup Configuration Components for Delphi

## IMPORTANT NOTE
This project is in active development, and is not ready for use at this time.

## Base Component
The base compnent to use is `TJDInnoSetupScript`. This encapsulates an entire Inno Setup script file. It can be installed into the IDE to drop onto your form or data module, then you can configure it to accomplish almost everything which you can do in a script. In the end, it can dynamically generate an Inno Setup script (.ISS). Future ideas include being able to compile the script directly from within your Delphi project.
